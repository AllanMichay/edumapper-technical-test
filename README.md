## Why a select in the highschool selection

Select is in my opinion the best way to have a large number of option while maintaining an appealing design at the end.
Radio buttons would have been too long. And ComboBox tend to be used in the case where you can have multiple selection.

## Small break

Sorry I had a 30 minute break in the middle since I had to attend a bit to my baby during lunch break so that my wife could eat.
Since I started at 11h30 and finished it at 14h, it goes in the limits of the 2 hours asked.
